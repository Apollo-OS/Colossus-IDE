# Colossus-IDE
A free and open source integrated development environment 

Colossus is an integrated development environment built to assist in the development of binaries and applications written for the Apollo Intermediate Language Virtual Machine (AIL-VM).

Colossus was created to include built-in debugging and compilation support for AIL-VM binaries which can then be ran using the AIL
runtime. These source files are saved with the __\*.avm__ extension, and are then compiled into AIL executables with the extension __\*.ila__.

Colossus also doubles as a small lightweight text editor with support for other file types (__\*.txt, \*.vb, \*.cs, \*.\*__)

Colossus IDE is released free-of-charge under a modified BSD 3-Clause Clear license.
You can view the license in the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file.
